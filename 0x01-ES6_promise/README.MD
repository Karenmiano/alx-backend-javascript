# ES6 Promises
This directory contains tasks that I completed, focusing on JavaScript promises.

## What are Promises?
Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They offer a more manageable approach to writing asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

A promise object includes:

* A .then() method to handle fulfilled promises.
* A .catch() method to handle rejected ones.
* A .finally() method to execute a block of code regardless of the promise's outcome.
